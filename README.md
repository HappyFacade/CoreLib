CoreLib
=======

CoreLib is a collection of reusable Objective-C source code to make various aspects of developing Mac and iOS applications easier.

CoreLib is designed so you can just use the parts you want/need and are not forced to adopt all of it. Just include CoreLib.h in your .pch and the files performing the tasks you are interested in.
